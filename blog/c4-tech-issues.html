  <h2>Cyber Security</h2>

        While big data grows and grows, the threat of a security breach is always looming in the background. Cyber security is a huge industry that is only expanding but I intend to focus on one area, employee training. Too often in my former place of work was I exposed to consumer information due to our customer's oblivious practices.

        At this point in the technical revolution, I understand there is a spectrum amongst users in regard to their ability, but simple security training programs should be able to resolve many mistakes that some employees are not even aware they are committing. It was apparent in my line of work that many of our customer's companies had never even broached the subject of cyber security. It became our job to chastise our contacts for sending unencrypted data or providing passwords at the drop of a hat. The latter problem comes into play in what is known as Social Engineering. Any one could pose as a 'Computer Expert' and easily extract root passwords and whatever else an employee has access to, they just have to ask. A brief one-hour training session would expose these employees to the risks they are creating and hopefully mitigate their rate of occurance in the future.
