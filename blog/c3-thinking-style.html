      Based on the <a href="http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html">Personal Thinking Style</a> quiz, I have a pretty strong corrolation with the Abstract Random style. I also had a significant and equal connection with the abstract sequential and concrete random, but I will focus on the abstract random for this post. I feel it does accurately describe my thinking style, in most settings.

        The abstract random learner/thinker will work well in the DBC environment given the chance to explore and personalize the experience. Knowing that I am an abstract random, I know I will need to work on my ability to receive feedback positively and my ability to provide a dialogue when I am working as a driver. There are some advantages to my style of thinking within DBC. So far, phase 0 has provided a pretty open-ended environment for learning. The guidelines are there but they are broad and give me a sense of having the reins in my hands.
