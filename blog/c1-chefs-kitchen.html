  <h2>Understanding DBC</h2>
  <h4>Sunday July 12, 2015</h4>

    There is a moment in the fireside chat when Shereef answers a question about staying beyond the 6 o'clock end time that I think really encapsulated the DBC experience. Nobody will stop me from leaving at 6 but this is my DBC experience. There will be no other time in my life that I will be surrounded with such resources and people who share the same motivation towards the same goal. This concept made me anxious and even more encouraged about what DBC has to offer.

    DBC feels far more open and flexible than any learning environment I have experienced previously. By flexible, I mean the rate of return can vary greatly based on not only my input but that of my cohort. Because of this, I understand the importance of being an active and engaging member myself and encouraging, through feedback and other means, the same from my cohort.

    From the time I first heard of DBC until now, my expectations have undergone a dramatic overhaul. I can say my initial impressions definitely coincided with the restaurant mindset (bootcamp -> job) but as I learned more and more about DBC, my expectations have grown tremondously. The focus on empathy, feedback and mindfulness makes me believe I will have already been rewarded significantly for my hard work before a job offer even comes about.
