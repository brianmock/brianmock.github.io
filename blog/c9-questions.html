      I'll start by saying I am not a big-time question asker. I tend to wait until I've exhausted all other options for trying to find my answer before asking somebody. There are quite a few negative aspects to this approach but I'll discuss the positives first. By taking the responsibility to find the answer myself, I know once I get the answer, I will have a very strong understanding. After sifting through all the unnecessary information I come across, I not only have a more focused idea of what I was trying to understand but also likely gleaned some additional knowledge even from the impertinent stuff I came across. The big negative is its affect on time management. I likely could have found the answer much quicker by asking someone, especially if part of their responsibility is being there to answer such questions. I would like to find a happy balance, there is definitely some good that can come from exploring the question on one's own. When the time comes to ask it, you will have a far more specific description of what you are looking for and will probably have the additional context covered as well.

      After reviewing some of the questions on the Google+ community, the questions that were answered most quickly were those that not only pinpointed the specific point of contension but also provided the context surrounding the problem. Most of the coding questions that did not provide their source code or the error message had to be prompted for these items before the issue could be resolved. If they had been present at the get-go, they would likely have received a solution sooner. The other big point is simply the clarity of the writing. If the question cannot be rationally understood, it is likely not going to be answered.
