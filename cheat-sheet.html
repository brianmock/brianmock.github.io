	<h3>Ruby</h3>
	<p>Ruby is an incredibly flexible dynamic programming language. It focuses on the idea that anything and everything is an object. When object-oriented principles are applied in Ruby, there is a shift in focus from the objects to the messages that are sent between them. Well-designed programs rely on trust between small, independent objects that have well-defined interfaces (the methods an object can respond to). Ruby also provides for dynamic typing, allowing users to create datatypes with unique methods. Below we will cover some of the built in methods in Ruby.</p>
	<h4>Ruby Enumerables</h4>
	<p>Enumerable methods provide a way to traverse, search and sort for collection classes. The built-in Ruby enumerable methods are automatically provided for objects of the Hash and Array datatypes but can be mixed in to any class that provides an `each` method and a practical way to sort the items in the class.</p>
	<ul>
		<tr><th>Method Name</th><th>Description</th></tr>
		<tr><li>each</li><li>loops through each object in the collection in order and executes the code block upon the object</li></tr>
		<tr><li>map</li><li>loops through each object in the collection in order, executes the code block upon the object and returns the entire group of modified objects in a new array</li></tr>
		<tr><li>inject</li><li>provides an additional variable (memo) that accumulates the results of the code block being applied to each object in the collection</li></tr>
		<tr><li>include?(obj)</li><li>returns true if any member of the collection is equal to the obj passed</li></tr>
	</ul>
	<h4>Destructive vs. Non-Destructive</h4>
	<p>These two types of methods are general categories that describe how the method treats the object the method is sent to. If the method returns the same object but modified or manipulated in some way, the method is destructive. If the method returns a new object that is modified or manipulated but leaves the original object untouched, that method is said to be non-destructive. Destructive methods are most oftened labeled with an exclamation point following the name.</p>
	<h4>Ruby Datatypes (Hashes, Arrays, Strings, Integers</h4>
	<p>Built-in ruby datatypes have a number of methods available. More information on each datatype and their methods can be found at the following links:
